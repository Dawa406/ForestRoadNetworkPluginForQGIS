name=Forest Roads Network
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=A plugin to create a vectorial network of forest roads of different types according to the flux of timber going through them.
about=This plugin contains several algorithms to allow the user to simply create a forest road network optimized in space to reduce construction costs. However, remember that it is not made for operational road planning, but rather strategical planning or theoretical exercises. A first algorithm creates the cost raster in which each pixel represents a cost of construction for a forest road; the second algorithm constructs the network using the cost raster; the third determines how the wood will flow through the network. The fourth determine the type of forest road (primary, secondary, etc.) according to those flux of wood and zones where temporary roads must be prioritized. For visual examples and more explanations, please refer to the github of the project linked below.

# Uncomment the following line and add your changelog:
changelog=1.0 - First stable version
	      1.1 - Algorithm for road type determination added
		  1.2 - Names of the algorithms changed; wood flux algorithm complete
		  1.3 - Road type Determination algorithm complete
		  1.5 - Cost Raster Creator algorithm added
				Huge performance boost via optimisation of the code
				Forest Road Creation algorithm can now "punish" angles of
				turning in order to avoid sharp turns
				Wood Flux Determination algorithm now accepts non-splitted lines
				and non-multipoints layers; it also can use information about quantity
				of wood contained inside fields attributes of the harvested polygons
		  1.6 - No more warning messages during the algorithm's process
		        Cost Raster Creator algorithm can now use an additional cost raster for more flexibility
				Cost Raster Creator algorithm now uses ranges of parameters for more flexibility 
				Forest Road Network Creation algorithm can now use a heuristic contained in a attribute of the polygons to access
				Road Type Determination algorithm can now use any type of roads defined by the user
				Road Type Determination algorithm can now restrict the zones where temporary roads can be made
