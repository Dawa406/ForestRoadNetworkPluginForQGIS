qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=A plugin to create a vectorial network of forest roads based on a cost raster and zones to reach.
about=This plugin contains an algorithm allowing you to create a vectorial network of forest roads according to a cost matrix, polygons to reach (like forest stands), and an existing road network to connect them to. A skidding distance can be given as an input so as to not create a road to a place that has a road already nearby. It uses the dijkstra algorithm in addition to a heuristic for the order in which the nodes to reach (inside your polygons) are going to be considered. It is not made for operational road planning, but rather strategical planning or theoretical exercises.
