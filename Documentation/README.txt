/***************************************************************************
 Forest Roads Network
                                 A QGIS plugin
 Create a network of forest roads based on zones to access, roads to connect
 them to, and a cost matrix.
 The code of the plugin is based on the "LeastCostPath" plugin available on
 https://github.com/Gooong/LeastCostPath. We thank their team for the template.

 1) USAGE
 
 To use the plugin, install QGIS v.3.0 minimum, and use the plugin repository to install the plugin.
 
 Once installed, it can be found in the category "Vector", or via searching in the toolbox (Name : "Forest Road Network Plugin")
 
 Each of the algorithms in the plugin have different inputs, described in their corresponding interface in detail. More detailed information can be found on github at https://github.com/Klemet/ForestRoadNetworkPluginForQGIS
 
 2) WARNINGS
 
 We take no responsibility concerning the use of this plugin to construct roads on the field. The precision and accuracy of the algorithm will depend heavily on the cost raster used, but nothing beats field survey.
 
 This plugin is not intended for operational planning; it can be used for strategic planning (exploration of options) of for theoretical exercises.

 We recommand that networks to be created with all of the different heuristics so as to compare them, and identify key differences that will lead to a better understanding of the landscape for the creation of forest roads.
 However, in our experience, the "Closest First" heuristic produces the most "realistic" forest road networks, as they correlate the most with existing forest roads.
